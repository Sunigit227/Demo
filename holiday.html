    <P>Our services
        We offer the full spectrum of services to help organizations work better. Everything from creating standards of excellence to training your people to work in more effective ways, assessing how you’re doing, and helping you perform even better in future. Very few others do this, and none have been doing it as long as we have.

        Developing standards
        If the standard you want doesn’t exist yet, we can help you create it. This can be a British Standard to meet an industry need, a PAS to fulfil an immediate market need or your own private standard which will improve and formalize your internal processes. 
        
        Get involved with standards
        There are many ways you can get involved from commenting on draft standards to becoming a consumer representative. Industry experts help us to develop and publish British Standards and books, gaining priceless knowledge, contacts and recognition by doing so. Interested in joining us?

        Buy standards at the BSI Shop
        Know what you want to get hold of? You can buy any current British Standard at the BSI Shop, as a PDF download or hard copy. You’ll also find much more here, including books and CDs explaining key standards, and how to license standards.
        
        Standards subscription services
        Get instant access to a vast array of standards, and discover quicker and easier ways to work with them.

        Training courses
        Our expert tutors bring alive the practical benefits that standards offer and make a permanent difference to how you work. We’ve designed our courses for organizations of all sizes and they include public courses, in-company (in-house/on-site) training and distance learning.
        
        In-company training
        This option means your people study in the setting where they’ll use their skills. It also saves you the cost and disruption of sending your people away to train. Plus you can reduce the level of risk to proprietary and confidential information.
        
        Assess
        Certification and verification
        We’ll check and test the quality of what you do, just as we already do for thousands of clients in over 150 countries worldwide. And with more full-time assessors than any other certification body, we are one of the largest and most experienced certification bodies you could find.
        
        Product certification
        Whatever stage of development you’re at, we can test your products. From research and development, pre-production, prototype, batch and audit to full compliance testing, we have one of the widest testing and certification capabilities in the world.
